# Assistant — Full Stack

A production-ready AI chat application. It runs **local models through Ollama
first** and falls back to **cloud AI** (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, xAI
Grok, Meta Llama) when no local model is installed or a local model fails.

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Python 3.13 with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node.js 20.9+,
and optionally [Ollama](https://ollama.com).

```bash
# 1. Local models (optional but recommended)
ollama pull llama3.2

# 2. API  → http://localhost:8000/docs
cd api
uv sync
cp .env.example .env            # add cloud API keys here if you have them
uv run fastapi dev app/main.py

# 3. Web  → http://localhost:3000   (new terminal)
cd web
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Or with Docker: `cp api/.env.example api/.env && docker compose up --build`.

## Voice mode (LiveKit)

Voice mode appears as a sound-wave button in the empty message box once the
API has LiveKit credentials. It needs a [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io)
project, because speech-to-text, text-to-speech, turn detection and noise
cancellation run on LiveKit Inference.

```bash
# api/.env and agent/.env: the same three values from your LiveKit project
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://<your-project>.livekit.cloud
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=...
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=...

# Voice agent (new terminal; API must be running)
cd agent
uv sync
uv run python voice_agent.py dev
```

With Docker: fill in agent/.env, then `docker compose --profile voice up --build`.

How a session flows:

```
Browser ──POST /api/voice/session──► API: new room + token that dispatches the agent
   │                                     (remembers the chosen model and earlier chat)
   └──WebRTC (mic + speaker)──► LiveKit ◄── agent: STT → turn detection → reply → TTS
                                                │
                                   POST /api/voice/chat  (same model dropdown,
                                   Ollama first, cloud fallback as text chat)
```

- Replies use the model picked in the dropdown, with the same fallback as
  text chat. The agent shows which model answered.
- Talking over the assistant interrupts it; **Stop** and **Esc** do too.
- Transcripts are saved into the chat (tagged *Spoken*), so a voice
  conversation can continue by typing and vice versa.
- If a model fails the assistant says so out loud and the UI shows the
  reason; if the agent is not running the UI says so after 20 seconds.
- Anyone who can reach `/api/voice/session` can start a (billed) voice
  session, so put it behind your login before going public, and set the same
  `VOICE_AGENT_TOKEN` in api/.env and agent/.env so only the agent can call
  `/api/voice/chat`.

Voice settings (agent/.env): `VOICE_STT_MODEL`, `VOICE_STT_LANGUAGE`,
`VOICE_TTS_MODEL`, `VOICE_TTS_VOICE`, `VOICE_GREETING`, `VOICE_INSTRUCTIONS`,
`VOICE_NOISE_CANCELLATION`, and `VOICE_LLM` (`app`, or a LiveKit Inference model
id to bypass the app). Offer a voice picker with `VOICE_VOICES` in api/.env.

## How model selection works

The model dropdown shows three groups:

| Option | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Auto** (default) | First installed Ollama model; if none, the first cloud provider with a key |
| **Local · Ollama** | Every chat model you've pulled, with size and parameter count |
| **Cloud (fallback)** | One sub-menu per provider whose API key is set, listing its live models |

If the chosen model fails before replying (Ollama stopped, model deleted, key
out of quota), the API automatically tries the next option and the reply shows
a small note saying which model answered instead. Set
`ALLOW_CLOUD_FALLBACK=false` in `api/.env` to turn this off.

Cloud order is controlled by `CLOUD_PRIORITY`, and each provider's preferred
fallback model by `*_MODEL` (e.g. `OPENAI_MODEL`). Model lists are fetched live
from each provider, so new models appear without code changes.

## Quality checks

```bash
cd api && uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run pytest
cd web && npm run typecheck && npm run build
```

## Production checklist

- Put both services behind HTTPS (a reverse proxy or your platform's load balancer).
  Keep response buffering off for `/api/chat` so replies stream.
- Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` (hides `/docs`) and a real `CORS_ORIGINS` if the
  API is called from another domain.
- Add authentication and rate limiting before exposing the API publicly;
  cloud calls cost money.
- Chat history is stored in each user's browser today. Add a database when you
  add user accounts.
